To famed Achilles, invincible warrior, the king gave command of a thousand ships.\\n\\nAcross stormy seas and salted beach, soldiers sieged the city. Arrow and stone, blade and barb bounced from Achilles’ skin. Bathed as a babe in the River Styx by his Nereid mother, his hide was hardened, imperviously made. Through every charge, every death-defying battle, Achilles was at the fore. Troy hung poised to crumble.\\n\\nUntil Agamemnon gave slight to the mighty myrmidon. In grave offense, Achilles pulled his forces from the field. Hector, boldest, bravest, eldest of the Trojan princes seized the chance to push the Greeks to the sea. Water’s reflection mirrored scorching sails as Hector fired their ships. All seemed lost until Achilles rose to meet him. Fierce and fast the two titans fought, but Hector’s spear felled Achilles fair. Though Patroclus, it was, in the armor of Achilles, not Achilles who lay dead.\\n\\nWrathful at the loss of his faithful friend, Achilles donned armor newly-made and challenged Hector alone. Spear and blade and amor rang, but Achilles could not be harmed. Hector, prince of Troy, died in battle that day.\\n\\nParis, brother lost, tearful-eyed, let arrow loose, guided by divine envy. For there were Gods that could not suffer Achilles to survive. Straight and true the arrow flew and harpooned Achilles’ heel, where his mother held him when submerged. The wound was deep, his weakness found, Achilles met his end.\\n\\nA decade thence, from Hades’ depths, Achilles has been drawn. Armored now, upon the heel, revenge his only aim. For envious Gods stole from him his glory and his life. Now they tremble at the wrath of the man who cannot be harmed."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Noxious Fumes","Ability_5":{"Id":7822,"Summary":"Combustion","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"5 (+10% of your Magical Power)","description":"Damage per Tick:"}],"description":"After hitting with 4 Basic Attacks, Agni will gain a Buff.

Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\\n\\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\\n\\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\\n\\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.2,"Ability1":"Hive","Ability_5":{"Id":9380,"Summary":"Bees!","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":null,"cost":null,"cooldown":null,"rankitems":null,"description":"Enemies afflicted by Bees! take damage every .5s for 2s, are revealed on the minimap, and swarm nearby enemies.

Universally, she is adored. \\n\\nLess so are her brothers, namely Susano-o, bringer of storms, whose jealousy of his sister’s popularity drove him to burn her golden rice fields and shatter the sacred looms of her people. Grief stricken at the destruction, Amaterasu sealed herself inside a deep cavern. Her people suffered and the realm fell into crushing darkness. \\n\\nFor an unknown time, she stayed there, hidden away from the atrocities of the world. Until, one day, came a thumping from outside. At first, she tried to ignore it, but curiosity called. Moving aside the great stone sealing the cavern, she peered cautiously out, only to stare into a polished bronze mirror. Blinded by her own reflection, Amaterasu was forced to creep further out to find the source of the sound. Hands grabbed her from either side and pulled her free of the cave. Gathered around were hundreds of friends and loved ones. Atop a wide tub danced Usume, Goddess of Mirth, creating the erratic drumming to the joy of all. Amaterasu smiled and light came back to the world. \\n\\nSeeing all those that depended on her, all those that loved her, Amaterasu vowed never again to hide away from calamity. She would, instead, face it, just as the dawn rises each new day."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.5,"Ability1":"Shifting

They protected the ship at dawn and dusk from the world serpent, Apep, who lurked at the horizon. Courageous, formidable, and above all, intelligent, Anhur defended the vessel with his spear and wits, outsmarting and distracting the serpent until feral Bastet delivered a killing blow.  With Apep gone, Ra became Pharaoh, Bastet, the Goddess of Cats and Women, and Anhur donned the mantle of the God of War.  This is how he became known as the Slayer of Enemies.\\n\\nAs time went on, another feline Goddess, Menhet, ran away from the Pantheon, spurning Ra. Anhur vowed to bring her back from the distant lands of Nubia to appease his father, but when he finally caught up with Menhet, he was enraptured and fell in love. He tied a rope to her neck and led her home, where he requested Menhet become his wife, a boon Ra happily granted.\\n\\nFor Egyptians, warfare is more than bloody battle, it's a means to break the chains of tyranny.

For their worship, tides remain calm, rivers contained, and rainfall for crops plentiful. It was not always like this, however. Long ago, Ao Kuang grew greedy and expected greater sacrifices. When they were not given, he sent floods, tidal waves, and devastating storms, striking so much fear into the people they dared not speak of this violence to the Jade Emperor. Ao Kuang enjoyed his total control.\\n\\nThen came Sun Wukong to his undersea palace seeking a weapon for his famous journey to the West. Despite the offer of other weapons, Sun Wukong took the Ruyi Jingu Bang, an immense pillar that aided in controlling the tides. It was believed none could even lift it, but Sun Wukong spun it with ease. As if this were not humiliating enough, Sun Wukong demanded other gifts of armor, shoes, and helm, all of which Ao Kuang was forced to supply.\\n\\nNext, the demigod boy Nezha, playing in a stream, inadvertently shook Ao Kuang’s palace. Annoyed, the Dragon-God set forth his favorite scout to kill the child, but Nezha defended himself and the scout was slain. Furious, Ao Kuang ordered his third son to destroy Nezha, yet Nehza slew him as well. Completely outraged, Ao Kuang went to Nezha’s father and threatened to take the issue before the Jade Emperor, but Nezha tackled the Dragon-King and forced him to submit.\\n\\nSuch repeated shame and humiliation have both humbled Ao Kuang and tempered his fury to steely resolve.

So wondrous is she to behold that one look can inspire tears, desire, jealousy, and love. Yet, beneath her flawless exterior resides a heart burdened with insecurity.\\n\\nInattentive and hideous to look upon, her husband, Hephaestus, unknowingly leaves Aphrodite feeling lonely and worthless. She finds consolation in the arms of other men such as Ares, or validation by competing in any contest of beauty she encounters.\\n\\nAt a wedding attended by all the Gods, a golden apple appeared, inscribed with the words \"to the fairest.\" Immediately Aphrodite, her mother Hera, and sister Athena quarreled over it. Zeus elected Paris, Prince of Troy, to choose a victor. In exchange for being named the fairest, Aphrodite offered any woman in the world as his wife, so Paris agreed. However, he chose Helen as his wife, and their love began the catastrophic Trojan War.\\n\\nNow, a new war brews, but this one between Gods, not men. While the battlefield is no place for the fairest of all, Aphrodite recalls the destruction between the Greeks and Trojans. Perhaps, this time, her beauty can be used to stop a war instead of start one. Perhaps, this time, she will discover the beauty within."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.6,"Ability1":"So Beautiful","Ability_5":{"Id":8754,"Summary":"Audacity","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"100%","description":"Attack Speed Buff:"},{"value":"5 Basic Attacks","description":"Buff Duration:"}],"description":"After 10 successful Basic Attacks, Apollo gains Audacity, attacking with both hands and increasing his Attack Speed by 100% for the next 5 Basic Attacks (hit or miss) he makes.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/audacity.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.7,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Across The Sky","HealthPerFive":8,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"Ability2":"Serenade","Ability_3":{"Id":8783,"Summary":"The Moves","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"70","cooldown":"15s","rankitems":[{"value":"70/115/160/205/250 (+60% of your Physical Power)","description":"Damage:"},{"value":"5/10/15/20/25%","description":"Movement Speed Buff/Debuff:"},{"value":"2s","description":"Buff Duration:"}],"description":"Apollo runs forward and slides on his knees, dealing damage, knocking aside all enemies and adding a stack of Audacity for each enemy hit.

Merely four days old, Apollo, gifted with a legendary bow, slew the Gaia Serpent and defied Hera.\\n\\nIn his humble youth, Apollo was a cattle herder. The trickster God Hermes stole Apollo’s charges and led them to a nearby cave. From the shell of a tortoise and the body of a cow, he crafted the first Lyre. Apollo finally caught up with Hermes, saw the instrument, and simply had to have it, trading the rest of his cattle to Hermes for it. Years later, Hermes would send his son, Pan, to challenge Apollo in a contest of musical prowess, but Apollo soundly defeated the satyr with dexterous mastery of the Lyre.\\n\\nAs Apollo grew into his rightful place among the Gods, his victories mounted, and the songs of the Faithful were sung more and more in his name.

Viewers traveled leagues just to see her art. So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.\\n\\nWhen Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.\\n\\nThey both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne’s weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight. Violently, she tore Arachne’s tapestry and pressed a finger to Arachne’s forehead. Twisting in anguish, Arachne fell to the ground as additional legs grew from her body, screaming as she transformed into the first spider.\\n\\nIt was an act of anger and pity, a lesson and a curse, for spiders are the greatest of weavers, and Arachne, in particular, was to weave for all time, but none could doubt the consequence for Arachne’s pride. Still, within her twisted heart, Arachne never forgave Athena, consumed by a dark hatred that can be sated only by the destruction of the Gods."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Shackles","Ability_5":{"Id":8317,"Summary":"Blessed Presence","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"Each completed aura item that Ares owns grants him 30 additional Magical Power.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/blessed-presence.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Cons":"","Ability4":"No Escape","HealthPerFive":8,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"Ability2":"Bolster Defenses","Ability_3":{"Id":8286,"Summary":"Searing Flesh","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"55/60/65/70/75","cooldown":"12s","rankitems":[{"value":"15/20/25/30/35 (+7% of your Magical Power)","description":"Damage per Tick:"},{"value":"1/1/2/2/3%","description":"% Max Health per Tick:"}],"description":"Flames pour forth from Ares' shield, engulfing enemies in a cone in front of him causing damage every .5s for 4s.

That he rides to battle on a chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds and delights only in the clash of battle and smell of bloodshed.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his father. Zeus has many sons, but only two with his wife Hera. However, the thunder God has long suspected Hera of having an affair that led to the birth of Ares, perhaps as revenge for all of Zeus’ infidelity. For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives. Often they have been on the opposite sides, most notably at the Battle of Troy, where Athena viciously wounded him and forced Ares to retreat.\\n\\nAres is the lover of the Goddess of Beauty. Though Aphrodite is married to Ares’ brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.\\n\\nAres is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds. The Spartans, however, know the unpredictable fury of their patron, and bind his statues in chains. This is, in part, to prevent Ares’ spirit of victory from escaping Sparta, and a vain effort to keep the God of War contained."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.5,"Ability1":"Transgressor's Fate","Ability_5":{"Id":16348,"Summary":"Still Target","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"Artemis deals 15% increased Basic Attack damage to gods and 30% to minions who are afflicted by Crowd Control.

Fortunately, she found an island that did not touch the ocean floor, so it was neither land nor sea, and thus bore her children. Artemis was born first, then miraculously aided as midwife in the birthing of her brother.\\n\\nArtemis spent her childhood in the hills and forests, training with her bow and hunting beasts. As she grew older and more beautiful, she also grew proud and ruthless when slighted or dishonored, especially against those that claimed to be better hunters than she. Adonis boasted this very thing and Artemis sent a wild boar to skewer him. The twin demigods Otos and Ephialtes, who could not be killed except by each other, threatened to kidnap Artemis and force her to marry one of them, but were tricked when Artemis, appearing as a doe, dashed between them. As they thrust with their spears they impaled each other. Finally, Actaeon, after peeping at Artemis while she bathed, was transformed into a stag and devoured by his own hunting dogs. Such is the wrath of Artemis.\\n\\nHer name is invoked by hunters seeking prey and by midwives during childbirth. Sacrifices are made in her name before a new military campaign.

The first crave the clash of steel and smell of slaughter, the latter know the wisdom of justice, the kindness of mercy, and that life should never be taken wantonly. These different warriors seek different Gods. Ares, God of War revels in the bloodletting, but his sister, Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, is patron to those who fight with dignity, and only when there is no other alternative.\\n\\nFavored daughter of Zeus, wise as ten thousand scholars, just as the scales themselves; Athena is a paragon of incorruptible virtue, and worshipped with righteous fervor. So revered is she that Athens, greatest city in all the world, is named for her, and regal temples adorn the countryside in her honor, each tended by loyal priestesses. To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.\\n\\nAt the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans. Athena rose to stop him, indirectly championing the Greeks, but directly keeping the order of divine law. Their fierce battle clashed in unspeakable proportions, ending only when Ares limped from the battle field, cowed by his sister and rival. With Ares diminished, the tide of the war shifted and the heroes of the Greek Army toppled Troy.\\n\\nIn times of war, prayers are sent to both Gods. Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms. Athena, ever cautious with lives, goes to battle without eagerness, but solemn necessity, for the Goddess of Wisdom knows honor is for the living.

Left unrestrained, the sun burns skin, scorches the land, blinds the eyes. Moonlight does no such thing. Like soft white petals it blankets the night, casting the world into mystical illumination. Never has it brought calamity or ruin, only the chance to see where once there was none. She is no different. Her mysterious radiance needs no other to shine.\\n\\nThese days, the night is less welcoming. Those loyal followers, the jaguars, whose whispered roars bellow into the silence of her domain, prowl at her command. While it is, no doubt, beyond the understanding of mortals, the very moonlight is threatened. A war unlike any before it would end all things.

None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\\n\\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He’s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the “Mysteries of the Vine,” a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\n\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the “gift.” Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\n\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.2,"Ability1":"Take Down","Ability_5":{"Id":8176,"Summary":"Insatiable Hunger","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"10%","description":"Attack Speed per Stack:"},{"value":"10%","description":"Movement Speed per Stack:"},{"value":"10s","description":"Buff Duration:"},{"value":"3","description":"Max Stacks:"}],"description":"Bakasura's attack and movement speed temporarily increases for each enemy that he kills.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/insatiable-hunger.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Regurgitate","HealthPerFive":9,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"Ability2":"Eat Minion","Ability_3":{"Id":8184,"Summary":"Butcher Blades","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","cooldown":"14s","rankitems":[{"value":"10/15/20/25/30","description":"Passive Physical Power:"},{"value":"10/25/40/55/70","description":"True Damage:"},{"value":"6s","description":"Duration:"}],"description":"Bakasura passively gains Physical Power.

Furious, Bakasura threatened to eat Bhima, which he just laughed off, goading the demon to attack him.

Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.\\n\\nWith her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases.

She favors only those for whom war is life; for that is where she thrives - not on the steps of hallowed basilicas or in whispered prayers, but in the blood-soaked mud, among the breathless armored troops, in the roar of victory.\\n\\nWhen Rome was young, Bellona ran with her armies, conquered her enemies, made her strong. As Rome aged and began to crumble, she fought only with her strongest and most cunning of worshippers, Lucius Cornelius Sulla.\\n\\nSulla rose through the ranks by accomplishing impossible deeds of heroism and ruthless prowess. His enemies feared him, his soldiers loved him, and everywhere he went, Bellona rode with him. Together they quelled the Germanic hordes, they broke the Social War, they sacked Athens. Sulla was utterly undefeatable, and it was the Goddess of War that made him so.\\n\\nBut the Roman Senate moved to displace Sulla and end his rise to glory.\\n\\n\"March on Rome,\" Bellona quietly urged, \"and you shall rise as no other.\"\\n\\nEmboldened, Sulla commanded his legions and took the city streets, Bellona at the fore, slaughtering the gladiator-slaves that stood against them. The Senate buckled. They cast the vote. Sulla became the first life-long dictator of Rome.\\n\\nDuring Sulla's reign, Bellona was worshipped for the Goddess she was. But Sulla had grown old. His wars were over. Bellona moved on, and Rome forgot.\\n\\nBut the forgotten are not gone. Gods clash in titanic conflict. It is in war she thrives.

Only a titan of tremendous power could cause such fear. He is the Render of Stone, the Earthsunder. He is Cabrakan, Destroyer of Mountains.\\n\\nProud, boastful, confident to the point of arrogance, Cabrakan revels in his strength, tearing down what the earth has labored to rise. These traits – and worse - he inherited from his sire, the demon bird Seven Macaw.\\n\\nSeeking to end Seven Macaw's entire lineage, the Hero Twins tracked Cabrakan by his quaking footfalls. They found him in a valley, surrounded by great peaks, shattering rock into dust.\\n\\n\"How mighty you are,\" they told him, playing to his pride.\\n\\n\"I am,\" he boasted.\\n\\n\"Can you shatter that distant mountain?\" they asked.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Cabrakan roared.\\n\\n\"You must be hungry,\" the Hero Twins offered.\\n\\n\"Always!\"\\n\\nAnd so they shot a bird from the sky for the giant to feast upon, yet as they turned the carcass over the flame, Hun-apu coated it with poisonous mud.\\n\\nWithout a thought, Cabrakan devoured the feast and rose, but already the poison had taken him. Teetering, losing sight, the Earthsunder collapsed. Mountains crumbled a final time. The valley became his tomb.\\n\\nYet vengeance is a cycle. Blood for blood, and a Titan is not so easily slain.

Patient, as always, Camazotz waited. Hunahpu, unable to hold out, lifted his head from concealment to check for light. Camazotz leapt, sliding through the blackness like a dagger through skin, and snatched Hunahpu’s head from his neck. Victorious, he presented his prize as a trophy to the other underworld Gods. However, come the morning light, Xbalanque fashioned a new head for his brother from a gourd and the two escaped while Camazotz was away.\\n\\nLong has Camazotz hung from his perch, watching as Gods clash and spill their sweet blood upon the earth.

Showers from above soak the earth, feeding seeds which grow into precious fruits and grains. Man and beast alike are sustained by this cycle. Without rain, this world would be barren and all living things would turn to dust. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain. But, like all great power, it did not come without cost.\\n\\nIn mankind’s earliest days there were no farmers, so they starved beneath the sun. For days, Chaac sought a way to feed them. Deep in the mountains he discovered a golden boulder and cleft it with his mighty axe. Within was Maize, the crop that would change the Mayan people forever, and Chaac was worshipped and adored for it.\\n\\nDrunk with pride, Chaac sought the object of his deepest desire, the wife of his brother. For a time, their affair remained secret, but that was not to last. Chaac’s brother, the Sun God, discovered them. Without a word, she dutifully returned to her husband and Chaac, realizing what he had done, let her go, but a rift formed between the two brothers that would never heal. In his grief, Chaac drove his axe into the sky, and from the wound tears of regret fell.\\n\\nSince then, Chaac has chosen a life free of pride and selfishness, devoting himself only to mankind. As a reminder of his greatest failing, he continues to cleave the heavens, washing the land in sustaining waters. Thus do crops grow. Thus do the people survive.

Such is the tale of Chang’e, Goddess of the Moon.\\n\\nAmong the immortals that lived in the Heavens, Chang’e was the most elegant dancer, like a dove on windswept currents. She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.\\n\\nYet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang’e were made mortal.\\n\\nChang’e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang’e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it.

Two opposites in one form. For all appearances, he is a centaur, bearing the torso of a man, and the body of a horse. Brutish, crude, and violent, the centaurs are not civilized creatures. Yet, Chiron is a scholar, a poet, an astrologer, and a teacher. And for all the wonder and glory of the world he tries to impart upon his illustrious students, Chiron, it seems, must constantly teach them the art of war. \\n\\nFame and legend are the hallmarks of his pupils. Perseus, who beheaded Medusa, Ajax, who battled bravely against Troy, and Achilles, who Chiron practically raised from infancy, all are figures of renown. But it is for their acts of violence, not art or science, for which songs are sung of these heroes. Chiron would prefer the world a more contemplative place where mankind adored nature and kindled bonds of friendship over scholarly discussions. \\n\\nThough, to his wizened eyes, the brink has been reached and the world he finds so fascinating tilts toward annihilation.

A warrior without equal that, alone, held an army at bay; a man of will and courage that resisted both the allure and wrath of the Morrigan; a figure of tragic prophecy, destined for greatness and an early grave. So many legends are there of his achievements they could be spoken for days and yet still more be told. And yet throughout his triumphs, his death loomed constant, foretold and certain.\\n\\nIn his early years, while still bearing the name Sétanta, he was already an impressive individual, catching the attention of King Conchobar with feats of strength and agility. Conchobar invited the boy to a feast hosted by the smith, Culann. Left unchained by mistake, Culann’s fearsome guard dog assailed Sétanta when he arrived. With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy. Cathbad, the same druid that named him, promised a group of boys, “Any that take up arms this day will become legends.” Seeking greatness, Cú Chulainn raced off to find weapons before hearing more. He saw years of victory, of achieving the impossible, of becoming a legend before him. Cathbad, however, was devastated, for he knew that those that took up arms that day were also foretold to die young."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.3,"Ability1":"Heart Bomb","Ability_5":{"Id":8235,"Summary":"Lovestruck","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"2%","description":"Damage/Healing per Heart:"},{"value":"8","description":"Max Stacks:"}],"description":"Every hit with a Basic Attack gives Cupid a Heart Stack that increases the damage or healing of his abilities.

He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid’s steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\\n\\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid’s invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\n\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid’s arrows and fell in love with him.\\n\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together.

She took delight in their screams of pain as she danced to playful music composed at her command, the musicians trembling for every note.\\n\\nSo grievous did these atrocities grow that the people rose up and overthrew their ruler. They stormed the gates, toppled the throne, and pursued Zhou to his bed chamber, where the crazed emperor finally took his own life.\\n\\nYet, Da Ji managed to escape and conceal herself.

Whether the sweeping arches of the Colosseum, the long stretch of the aqueducts, or the power the Servian Wall, none can truly claim they were the origin that “built” Rome. For as mighty as she has become, Rome might have never been were it not for the mischief of the Goddess Discordia.\\n\\nOnce known among the Greeks as Eris, the maligned Goddess of Strife, Discordia craved to unleash her full potential, to unravel the foundations of the mortals and deities that hated her. She found that opportunity through the vanity of others.\\n\\nConjuring a golden apple, Eris cast it forth. Upon it read the words ‘for the fairest.’ A phrase that would set Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite against one another. A phrase that would cause Paris to kidnap Menelaus’ wife, Helen. A phrase that would ignite the Trojan War.\\n\\nAs chaos swirled, as cities crumbled, as heroes both Greek and Trojan fell to each other’s blades and Gods grew to loathe one another, no one seemed to wonder from whence the golden apple came. It was masterful! Eventually, the Trojan War reached its peak, and Eris attached herself to the mortal Aeneus. She guided him safely from Troy, across the sea and wilderness, to the place where a new nation would be built. Here, Aeneus founded Rome.\\n\\nFree of the judgement she wore under the Greeks, bereft of the belittling glares of the other Gods, Eris was remade as Discordia. A Roman Goddess of importance and prominence. Indeed, Rome was not built in a day.

Yet the true  source of the disaster proved to be an evil dragon. With seven companions, Erlang Shen ambushed the beast. Cowardly and quick the dragon slithered into the rapid river waters, but Erlang Shen captured it with a great chain and bound it beneath a shrine. Thus the floods subsided.\\n\\nWhen Sun Wukong’s troublesome antics drew the ire of the Jade Emperor, Erlang Shen faced the Monkey King on the battlefield. For every form Sun Wukong took, Erlang Shen transformed as well. Across sea and sky and land they battled. Thus was Sun Wukong sent fleeing for his life.\\n\\nWhen the people were plagued by demons and monsters, Erlang Shen slaughtered them to keep his countrymen safe. Three-bladed spear in hand and hunting dog at his side, no evil could threaten the innocent or the Empire. Thus, Erlang came to be loved and worshipped.\\n\\nA Goddess mother and a mere mortal father, he is of two worlds. He is both sage and a soldier, humble yet regal, his veins filled with the blood of men and the divine blood of his uncle, the Jade Emperor. Having risen above his forbidden origins, Erlang Shen has proven himself among the greatest of heroes in the Jade Empire. Perhaps that is why he now takes the field.

Horrified, Hreidmar entombed the Aesir, for the otter was, in truth, his third son. Freedom would not be theirs until Loki returned with the hide filled with gold.  Refusing to be outdone, the Trickster God, stuffed the pelt to bursting with the cursed treasure of Andvarri. Hreidmar, unaware of the maligned hoard, greedily exchanged the Aesir for the wealth. That night, curling his powerful arm, Fafnir strangled his father and vanished into the frosted night with the cursed gold.\\n\\nAnd so it was that madness took him. Paranoid his last brother would steal the treasure, Fafnir guarded it jealously while the curse whispered in his ear. Slowly, surely, twisted he became, scaled and nightmarish. His breath turned to poison, his maw, fanged, his demeanor, fouler. A dragon, he became. The very symbol of greed.\\n\\nFor centuries Fafnir kept no company, but the War of the Gods grows ever closer, and the clink of coin runs rampant; a bulging sack on the belt of every warrior.

They can be petty, churlish, and worst of all, wrong. What are the consequences for their mistakes? They should have slain the wolf-beast Fenrir, but they chose instead to bind him. Despite the warnings and prophecies he would tear Odin apart at Ragnorok and devour the earth and sky, they did not end Loki's son. Now, terror roams free. It is unknown how, but Fenrir is Unbound.\\n\\nThrice they tried to bind him, each time convincing Fenrir that the chains were nothing more than a challenge for his strength, a test to see if he could shatter them. The first two God-forged fetters were easily broken beneath the beast’s terrible power, but the third was a ribbon, dwarf made, and Fenrir grew suspicious of the God’s intentions. As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir’s maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf’s leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr’s hand.\\n\\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory. But they were all warned and the Gods did nothing. Fenrir is hungry now, the first hunter, an alpha among sheep, but no flesh will satisfy his need. It is revenge he craves, and now he is Unbound."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Northern Lights","Ability_5":{"Id":16391,"Summary":"Mystic Warrior","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"Freya’s Melee Basic Attacks heal her for 6% of her Maximum Mana per successful hit.

Yet their queen, Freya, so irresistibly desirable, so uncompromising in warfare, make the Valkyries seem nothing more than plain paper dolls. She’s the object of desire for every God, every man, and the envy of every woman. Even the Frost Giants crave her for their own, often devising devious plans to trick or force her into marriage. But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.\\n\\nWere it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades. Her name literally means “the lady,” and none of more worthy of the title. She adores bright flowers, pleasant company, and the sweet lilt of a sad love song. She’s sensual and amorous, invoked by worshipers seeking to bear a child or find a lover. Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.\\n\\nOnce, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster.

Shiva, the supreme being, returned and found this child doggedly blocking his path. Fearing the safety of his wife, Shiva drew his sword and cut him down.\\n\\n“This is your son!” Parvati cried. “You must save him!”\\n\\nHurriedly, Shiva replaced the head of the child with the wisest creature in the world, that of an elephant. Thus, was Ganesha truly born.\\n\\nGenerous, warm-hearted, and optimistic, Ganesha has assumed authority over the very thing his mother tasked of him - obstacles. For those whose hearts are filled with boastful arrogance, Ganesha challenges progress. Financial difficulties, faulty materials, and unhappiness plague their every action. But, for the honest, the hard working, Ganesha clears the way. A life of good fortune, bright skies, and joyous laughter. \\n\\nObstacles can be either placed or removed. So, to Ganesha all mortals pray when starting a new endeavor, that their path will be open and their future bright. That he may grant them success.\\n\\nOnly with reluctance has Ganesha joined the Battle of the Gods. Violence is the last obstacle the elephant-God would ever place.

As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\n\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\n\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei’s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao’s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao’s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\n\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu’s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\n\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory.

It can be brutal and bloody, lacking all mercy, stripping away humanity, leaving only violent souls. Some believe war is about more than victory, some believe it is how that victory is won.

Fearing her child’s birth would slow the army’s advance, she tied bandages about her belly and held him within for 3 years, until the war was done. Each day, she prayed she would not lose the child, that he would be born strong. That he would be a God. As 8 banners descended from heaven, heralding his birth, her prayers were answered.\\n\\nHachiman embodies all a warrior should be. Temperate but fearless. Deadly not ruthless. Respectful, to enemies and allies alike. He understands that war cannot be stopped, so he teaches how war should be.\\n\\nEven in this, a war between Gods, Hachiman will retain his code.

In the end, he always gets his way.\\n\\nEldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, Hades was swallowed by his father as an infant along with five other siblings. Zeus, the youngest brother, escaped this fate and freed them once he’d grown strong enough to battle Cronus. Together, the six siblings defeated the Titans and banished them to the dark realm of Tartarus. Now the reigning Gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades drew lots for dominion. Hades drew the Underworld.\\n\\nOf the few that have entered the Underworld and come back, all speak dismally of the place, never wishing to return. Yet Hades, himself, rarely leaves the subterranean realm, constantly seeking ways to grow the numbers of the dead.\\n\\nWhen he desired a wife, Hades captured the radiant Persephone, daughter of the Goddess Demeter. Concealed in the Underworld, none could reach her, so Demeter cursed the land with a great famine. The other Gods pleaded with her to end it lest she destroy mankind, but she would not relent until her daughter was returned. Hades finally let Persephone leave, though not before feeding her pomegranate seeds. Having consumed the fruit, she was bound forever to Hades and required to return to her husband once per year to eat of the seeds again. This, it is said, is a time of mourning and the cause of winter.\\n\\nWhile many fear death and view it as evil, in truth, Hades endeavors only to keep balance. He is stern but fair. As God of the Dead and the Underworld, he views his authority on this matter absolute, forbidding anyone to leave his realm and growing wrathful when disobeyed or when someone tries to cheat death or steal from him.\\n\\nFor everyone, death is unavoidable and service to Hades inevitable.

Now, the forces of the great river are at his command!\\n\\nThroughout history, no river has been the source of more nourishment or more destruction than China’s Yellow River. Its basin valley was the cradle that birthed Chinese civilization, feeding fields with water and millions of tons of collected sediments, which give the river its yellow hue. The river is also treacherous and prone to flooding, destroying shoreline settlements and drowning thousands.\\n\\nLong ago, Feng Yi, a mortal man living along the riverside, watched in dismay as a storm stirred the waters and gorged the banks. It would not be long before the mighty river consumed his village. Both humble and wise, Feng Yi tied rocks to his belt before casting himself into the waters. This act of sacrifice did more than appease the angry river, it promoted Feng Yi to Godhood over it. Thus, he became He Bo.\\n\\nMuch time passed, and He Bo grew proud of his great river, so proud that he declared the Yellow River the biggest body of water anywhere. A passerby asked if He Bo had seen the North Sea, but He Bo dismissed the comment, for heavy rains were falling and the river was roaring and full. As time wore on, thought of the North Sea tickled his mind, so he made the journey. There, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea warmly met him.  Viewing the endless expanse of water, He Bo was humbled and returned to his River wiser.\\n\\nFor He Bo, there are no greater virtues than wisdom and humility. With the force of the Yellow River at his command, He Bo will remind his enemies what it means to be humble."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Decay (Restoration)","Ability_5":{"Id":9188,"Summary":"Stance Attunement","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"When Hel is in a stance, she gradually attunes to the strengths of that stance, gaining up to 20% damage in the Dark Stance and 20% healing in the Light Stance.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/stance-attunement.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.6,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Switch Stances (Light)","HealthPerFive":5,"ManaPerFive":5,"Ability2":"Hinder (Cleanse)","Ability_3":{"Id":9185,"Summary":"Repulse (Inspire)","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","cooldown":"12s","rankitems":[{"value":"60/90/120/150/180 (+30% of your Magical Power)","description":"Light Self Heal: "},{"value":"10/15/20/25/30 (+5% of your Magical Power)","description":"Light Heal per Tick:"},{"value":"25%","description":"Light Movement Speed:"},{"value":"6s","description":"Light Duration:"},{"value":"80/130/180/230/280 (+70% of your Magical Power)","description":"Dark Damage:"}],"description":"REPULSE (Dark Stance) - Hel conjures a burst of dark energy around her, damaging all nearby enemies.\n\nINSPIRE (Light Stance) - Hel conjures a burst of light energy around her, healing herself instantly and applying a heal over time to nearby allies that ticks every 1s.

She is both sides of two extremes.\\n\\nAs the daughter of Loki, the trickster God, Hel’s destiny, much like her brothers Fenrir and Jormungandr, was doomed to darkness from the start. Odin, the All-Father, uncovered prophecies that Hel and her siblings would be the source of great calamity resulting in Ragnarök, the battle that would end all things. In an effort to prevent this, he cast each of the three into different realms; not quite a prison, though far from freedom. For Hel, Odin gave her charge of the realm of the dead, specifically those that died of sickness and old age. For himself, Odin retained Valhalla for those that died in battle.\\n\\nAt birth, Hel’s face was cast half in shadow, half in light; she was both living and dead, so took immediately and graciously to her new role, gifting Odin with the ravens Huginn and Muninn in appreciation.

Yet, Like all of Jupiter’s illegitimate children, Hercules once drew the ire of Juno, and though he is now known as a hero, his greatest achievements might never have been done without Juno’s initial tragic involvement.\\n\\nShe struck Hercules mad, and he slew his own children.\\n\\nOnce recovered, grief stricken, Hercules sought penance for his crimes. An oracle of Jupiter advised he should pledge his service to the king Eurystheus, and so Hercules reluctantly did so. Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\\n\\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast’s impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion’s roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\n\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero’s return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.8,"Ability1":"Ricochet","Ability_5":{"Id":11027,"Summary":"Suntouched","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"After taking a critical hit, Hou Yi can’t be critically hit again for 3s.","menuitems":[{"value":"Passive","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/suntouched.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Sunbreaker","HealthPerFive":8,"ManaPerFive":5,"Ability2":"Mark of the Golden Crow","Ability_3":{"Id":11636,"Summary":"Divebomb","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"70/75/80/85/90","cooldown":"15s","rankitems":[{"value":"70/110/150/190/230 (+60% of your physical power)","description":"Damage:"}],"description":"Hou Yi launches into the air, and for a short time may target some distance away to quickly dive towards the ground damaging any enemies in the immediate area.

From whence none knew, ten suns rose above the horizon. Such incessant light and heat ravaged the earth, wilting fields of grain, drying rivers, even melting forged metal. Bent beneath the scorching rays, the people begged the Emperor-God Di Jun to aid them. In reply, he called the great archer, Hou Yi.\\n\\nArmed with a mystical red bow and a quiver of white arrows, Hou Yi traveled to Earth. What he found was a barren land. Shielding his eyes, he peered to the sky where the ten suns cruelly flared.\\n\\nNocking arrow to bow, Hou Yi loosed a warning at the suns hoping to frighten them away, but they impassively remained. So Hou Yi drew again and fired a killing shot. Pierced, the sun exploded in color and a giant red raven with three legs fell to the earth, slain by the white arrow.\\n\\nEight times more Hou Yi drew arrow to cheek. Eight shots more he let fly. Eight more bursts rent the sky, and eight more ravens fell dead. But one sun he left, and so fearful of Hou Yi's archery, this sun behaved, dipping below the horizon.\\n\\nNow armed with the power of the red ravens he smote, sending light and fire against those that threaten the world, be it monster or beast, dragon or sun, man or God, Hou Yi is the Defender of the Earth."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.16,"Ability1":"Somersault","Ability_5":{"Id":16398,"Summary":"Infused Strikes","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"After using an ability, Hun Batz's next Basic Attack will deal 20% increased damage.

When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.\\n\\nFrom the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.\\n\\nIsis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.\\n\\nFleeing Set’s wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set’s rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.\\n\\nHer bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end.

Venturing into the unknown. Deviating from a path of safety and certainty into something unexpected. But life is change; a journey through doorways both physical and emotional, with every moment a passage to something new, and it is Janus, God of Portals and Transitions that governs this.\\n\\nBearing two faces, Janus is ever looking to the future and to the past, knowing both but controlling neither. He is only the in-between, found in the changing of seasons, at the birth of a child, at the entrances to the temple and the tavern. For this reason the Romans named the first month after him: January – a portal between the old year and the new.\\n\\nYet the Roman emperors also attribute a strange tradition to Janus. At each end of his temple stand massive doors. In times of peace, these doors are closed, but in times of war, flung open. As Rome rose to power, rarely were these doors shut, but almost four hundred years of peace have clothed Rome since then and the temple has grown dusty with absence. These days, however, the doors are open once more.

King among these monsters is Kuzenbo; bigger, stronger, and more cunning than the rest, but just as infantile.\\n\\nKuzenbo led his nine thousand Kappa followers to Japan, where they harried river villages and fishing boats, using their unnatural strength to pull mortals below. So clever, so hungry had the Kappa become, that Japan’s army marched to fight back, but they were no match.\\n\\nAs the bowl-shaped indentation atop a Kappa’s head is filled with water, that Kappa grows impossibly stronger - far stronger than a mortal. Yet, bound by their strange sense of honor, a Kappa must bow when bowed to, spilling their power upon the ground. It is the only known way to defeat one.\\n\\nAnd of the countless battles Kuzenbo has fought, he was defeated only twice.

It’s a word used to describe those that break the rules, that take what they want, and care nothing for those hurt along the way. Loki, the trickster God, would say villainy is nothing more than a point of view.\\n\\nThe point of view of fools too mindless to seize opportunity.\\n\\nOf course, with Loki now on the loose, the implications are dire. The end of times may be at hand. The final battle, Ragnarok, possibly on the horizon, for it was foretold that Loki would break free of his prison and herald the horrific final battle that would leave the Gods slain, the heavens sundered, and the world in ashes. None are more eager for that time of chaos than Loki.\\n\\nBefore his confinement, Loki’s malicious mischief managed to affect every God in ways both beneficial and terrible. Yet Loki’s most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\\n\\nBaldr’s prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr’s brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone’s horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\\n\\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki’s wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\\n\\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc. If the prophetic Volva are correct, and they always are, then the end of all things has finally come."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.6,"Ability1":"Viper Shot","Ability_5":{"Id":11153,"Summary":"Sidewinder","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"Medusa suffers no movement penalty when side strafing and half of the movement penalty when moving backward.","menuitems":[{"value":"Passive","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/sidewinder.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Petrify","HealthPerFive":8,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"Ability2":"Acid Spray","Ability_3":{"Id":11157,"Summary":"Lacerate","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"70","cooldown":"15s","rankitems":[{"value":"80/130/180/230/280 (+80% of your physical power)","description":"Damage:"},{"value":".5s","description":"Root Duration:"},{"value":"50% for 3s","description":"Healing Reduction:"}],"description":"Medusa quickly slithers forward rooting and slashing the first enemy god she encounters.

There is only one whose hair is made of slithering serpents, only one with skin of scales, and only one whose very gaze can turn man, beast, or God to stone. Medusa, the Gorgon.\\n\\nStories claim she was beautiful once. A priestess of Athena. Loyal and devout in action, but Poseidon was determined to make her his own. It was the fairness of her features, the golden of her hair, that attracted the Sea God. Medusa, a mortal maiden, could not refuse.\\n\\nWhen Athena learned of Medusa's betrayal, she punished the priestess. Those fair features were hideously wrought and those golden locks twisted to hissing vipers. Anyone that met her eyes was petrified – a statue for all eternity.\\n\\nMedusa fled, frightened, ashamed and furious.

Mercury can leap the space between lightning and thunder, outfox the fox king, and reach tomorrow before the sun.\\n\\nAs an infant, Mercury escaped the watchful eye of his half-brother, Apollo, stole his cattle, fashioned a lyre from a tortoise shell, and snuck in a nap, all before Apollo found him missing. His father, Jupiter, found the child’s mischief boisterously entertaining, and awarded him the task of delivering messages for the Gods, traveling between the Heavens, the Earth, and even to the depths of the Underworld.\\n\\nNow war looms and Mercury races to keep the lines of communication open, though he is often caught in the thick of battle. No stranger to combat, he once slew the monster Argus, the demon with one hundred watchful eyes, using speed and guile alone. But this war is different.

During this time, the Dragon Gods, led by Ao Kuang, terrorized the people, sending floods and storms, and demanding not just food, but child sacrifices to feast upon as well.\\n\\nInto this world was Nezha born, a full grown boy with laughter in his eyes, trained by the immortal sage Taiyi Zhenren, who gave him the powerful Universe Ring and Armillary Sash. Youthful and carefree, Nezha was also headstrong, often arguing with his father what was right and wrong.\\n\\nBut youth does not last forever, and Nezha’s life changed defending two friends against a captain of Ao Kuang’s army. Insulted, the Dragon God commanded his third son, Ao Bing, to defeat the boy, but in the end, Nehza slew his opponent. Furious with grief, Ao Kuang demanded Nezha’s father make reparations for the offense committed by his son, or he would send floods and storms to ravage the land. Nezha, humbly, sacrificed himself to appease the Dragon God, but evil Ao Kuang sent storms anyway.\\n\\nTaiyi Zhenren worked his wisdom, and from the petals of a Lotus plant, Nezha was reborn. The immortal sage gave him new weapons – the Fire Tipped Spear and Wind Fire Wheels – weapons to challenge even the Dragon God and defeat him once and for all.\\n\\nTime has passed since Ao Kuang’s ruin, but the winds of war are rising and new Gods of Tyranny challenge the safety of the defenseless.

With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs, and raced to the broken World Pillar. One leg she used to prop the Heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between Heaven and Earth was restored, but the world was never the same. Skies cleared, but the stars had shifted. Seas retreated, but rivers drained westward. Everything leaned, but the End was averted.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshipped to this day.\\n\\nYet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all Pantheons have chosen Earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago.

Isis, Osiris’ wife, secretly fled while Set plunged the kingdom into darkness. For years she toiled to reassemble her husband while his spirit form, his Ba, endured. Yet for all her searching, she could not find every part of him, and Isis was forced to reanimate Osiris without. Though not strong enough to defy Set in this incomplete form, Osiris gave Isis a son that would topple the tyrant Set and restore balance to Egypt.\\n\\nWhat remains of Osiris is a fragment of what he once was. Robbed of his crown over the earth, he now governs the realm of the dead with the same benevolence he ruled the living. But darkness looms again, and though broken, Osiris refuses to sit idly by.

Those who worship Pele speak of her as Madame Pele or Tutu Pele, while others know her as Ka wahine ‘ai honua, ‘the woman who devours the land’. Though she is capable of great acts of destruction, and possesses the temper to provoke such acts, Pele is both destroyer and creator. It was through her mastery over the world’s molten core that she wrought the Hawaiian Islands into being, forging them from the lava that ruptured forth from the mouths of her volcanoes. They are places of immense beauty, lush and brimming with life, and by looking upon and revelling in such beauty, you offer Pele worship.\\n\\nBorn of Kane Milohai, who wrought the earth, sky and heavens, and the Earth goddess Haumea, Pele is one of fourteen children, seven sisters and seven brothers. It is from the enmity between these siblings that Pele arrived in Hawaii, after her exile at the hands of Kane Milohai for her fiery temper and conflict with her sister Namakaokahai, goddess of the Sea. Pursued across the oceans by Namakaikahai, Pele wrought Hawaii into a paradise, making her home within the great calderas of the volcanoes that stand sentinel across the island chain.\\n\\nTo worship Pele is to grant one’s devotion to a goddess of terrible power, one who can shape and render a grand, vibrant world into being at her slightest whim, and burn it to ashes just as quickly. But just as her worshippers are devoted to Pele, she devotes herself to them as a force of divine protection and care.

What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\n\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father’s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\\n\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus’ daughter. A competition was held – each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\n\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Celestial Beam","Ability_5":{"Id":7660,"Summary":"Speed of Light","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"6%","description":"Movement Speed:"},{"value":"3","description":"Max Stacks:"},{"value":"15s","description":"Lifetime:"}],"description":"Every time Ra uses an ability, his movement speed is increased.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/speed-of-light.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.5,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Searing Pain","HealthPerFive":7,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"Ability2":"Divine Light","Ability_3":{"Id":7661,"Summary":"Solar Blessing","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"65/75/85/95/105","cooldown":"18s","rankitems":[{"value":"20/32/44/56/68 (+20% of your Magical Power)","description":"Damage per Tick:"},{"value":"10/20/30/40/50 (10% of your Magical Power)","description":"Heal per Tick:"},{"value":"10/15/20/25/30","description":"Protections:"},{"value":"6s","description":"Lifetime:"}],"description":"Ra summons a pillar of blessed light.

Without Ra, there would be no sun.\\n\\nRa is a guardian, the keeper of Ma’at - order and truth, and master of the sun. Each day he sails across the sky in a golden ship, and each night traverses the underworld, bringing light and warmth to the dead beneath the horizon. For those in the scorched South, Ra was the first God, creator of earth and sky and father to all other Gods.\\n\\nBut Ra’s time is fading like a twilight sky. His descendants have grown in power and prominence and seek to replace him as the figure of authority. His own granddaughter, Isis, cleverly poisoned him by secretly summoning a viper under his feet. When he stepped on it, the serpent’s venomous bite poisoned him. Isis promised to heal Ra if he revealed to her his True Name. At first, he refused, for knowledge of his True Name would give Isis unparalleled power over him, but as the pain mounted, Ra was forced to relent. Isis kept her word and Ra was healed, though the cost may have been too high.\\n\\nLight can heal, but light can also burn, and the great protector is showing signs of wrath not seen since mankind’s insolence. In that rare moment of anger, Ra sent his daughter, Hathor, in the form of a lion, to devour the people. However, he ended her bloody feeding before she consumed all mankind.

Strong, humble, handsome, patient, devout; he is what mankind strives to be, yet, for all our flaws, can never reach.\\n\\nWhen a neighboring kingdom, cursed by Ravana's magic, asked for aid, Rama answered, despite the misgivings of his father. With his brother Laksharma, Rama set out and slew a horde of demons. At the palace, Rama cleansed the curse by freeing the queen from stone. The city celebrated and Rama was invited to string Shiva's bow – with the prize princess Sita's hand in marriage. Shiva's bow could not be lifted by any man, let alone strung, but Rama broke the bow in half. He and Sita wed immediately.\\n\\nReturning home, Rama was to be crown prince, but the jealousy of queen Kaikeyi forced Rama into exile, where he's remained these past fourteen years.\\n\\nYet Rama was recently seen on the field of battle.

In his pursuit of immortality, he sacrificed his very life. He cut off his own head.\\n\\nAgony and pain met him as it regrew. He was greeted not by Death, but by rejection. Shiva the destroyer did not want him. Ravana was undaunted. Nine more times his head was offered, and on his tenth sacrifice, finally Shiva was sated.\\n\\nFor the Demon King, Shiva granted a boon. Instead of immortality, he gained invulnerability against those he viewed as threats: Gods and Demons.

Those that cling to survival whisper panicked tales of enormous black tentacles tipped with slavering hound heads ravaging whole ships to splinters with pitiless precision.

They write she was once a beautiful Naiad, wronged by a jealous priestess and transformed. Yet the old poems say she was born this way, beget by gods full of jealousy and loathing; dropped into the sea to terrorize mankind.\\n\\nWould that she had remained in the sea, but the nightmare has come ashore.

Celebrating, the Gods drank of mead and feasted on roasted beast while the corpse of their defeated foe, the Jotun Thjazi, lay cold nearby. For decades were they at odds. Now, that conflict was ended. Odin and his ilk openly boasted of their achievements, laughing and cheering while the floor ran wet with spilled spirits. \\n\\nThen, the doors swung wide, breathing icy winter wind across the hall. There she stood, spear in hand, skin, porcelain pale, clad in snow dusted furs, and eyes blue as glacier ice but smoldering with vengeful fire. Skadi, the Jotun’s daughter had come. \\n\\nTransfixed by her beauty, the gathered Gods sought to dissuade her from violence. As a symbol of honor, Odin cast the eyes of her father into the heavens to twinkle as stars for eternity. Skadi was not moved. A life for a life, she demanded. \\n\\nIt was Loki that softened her heart with humor and dance. So jovial was he that, at last, her frozen features cracked a smile. \\n\\nA wedding! Odin declared. Skadi would marry a God and so, herself become a Goddess. This would be her payment for the life of her father. Now warmed to them, Skadi agreed. Blindfolded, she was to choose her husband by only his feet. Eligible men came forth and Skadi made her choice. \\n\\nTheir marriage did not last. Niord was a God of Summer and Skadi a Goddess of Winter. After a few years, they amicably parted ways. Skadi returned to the snow-capped mountains of her youth, but without her father or husband, she soon grew lonely. Word spread of a war between the Pantheons. Odin and Loki, Niord and Ullr; these Gods were her family now, and Skadi would not lose the only family she had left."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Charge Prey","Ability_5":{"Id":7952,"Summary":"Blessing of the Nile","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"7","description":"Protections:"},{"value":"6s","description":"Lifetime:"},{"value":"3","description":"Max Stacks:"}],"description":"Sobek's Basic Attacks and abilities that hit an enemy grant him Protections for a short time.","menuitems":[{"value":"Buff","description":"Ability:"},{"value":"Self","description":"Affects:"}]}},"URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/blessing-of-the-nile.jpg"},"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Cons":"","Ability4":"Lurking in the Waters","HealthPerFive":6,"ManaPerFive":4.5,"Ability2":"Tail Whip","Ability_3":{"Id":7951,"Summary":"Sickening Strike","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","cooldown":"13s","rankitems":[{"value":"60/100/140/180/220 (+30% of your Magical Power)","description":"Damage:"},{"value":"50%","description":"Healing Reduction:"},{"value":"4s","description":"Healing Reduction Lifetime:"},{"value":"20/30/40/50/60 (+10% of your Magical Power)","description":"Heal:"}],"description":"Sobek does an axe attack that damages all enemies in front of him and lowers their healing received.

Mani, of the moon, was contemplative, obedient, calm. Sol, conversely, became willful, spirited, passionate. His children were everything a father could dream, but Odin and his ilk were not pleased. For a father's hubris, Mani and Sol were punished.\\n\\nTo the sky, they were sent, each to lead the chariot that dragged the sun or the moon. At their heels were loosed the bloodthirsty sons of Fenrir. Hungry wolves, relentless in pursuit of their prey.\\n\\nResigned, Mani guided his steeds through the night, ever ahead of his hunter, but Sol did not accept her fate. Furious at the Gods, she taunts and challenges the wolf Skoll as she blazes across the sky, unleashing her spite on the only opponent she can reach.\\n\\nOdin has never shown signs of regret for his decision, but now war is upon the land. His attentions are turned. Sol, normally confined to her chariot has found a way to send her flaming essence to the battlefield.

He defied death itself by wiping his name from the Book of Life and Death, and united many of the other monster tribes who sought to ally with him, an act that garnered the attention of the Jade Emperor.\\n\\nIn an effort to better control the Monkey-King, the Jade Emperor awarded him a title, but when Sun Wukong discovered his new position was little more than “stable boy” he grew angry and declared himself “Great Sage, Equal of Heaven,” and waged war on the heavens. For this treasonous act, he was finally captured and imprisoned beneath a mountain for five centuries.\\n\\nAt long last, the humble monk Xuanzang was seeking disciples to protect him while on his legendary Journey to the West to collect the Indian Sutras. Sun Wukong gladly agreed to serve him, but the Buddha wrapped a golden circlet around the Monkey King’s head so that Xuanzang could control him. With three other disciples, they faced eighty one trials during their quest, and collected the sutras.

Their father, Izanagi, would have none of it and decreed that Susano live in the Underworld. His mood dark at this news, Susano committed heinous acts of vandalism and murder. Acts that sent Amaterasu into shameful hiding.\\n\\nCast low, Susano descended to earth on his way to the Underworld. He carried only his Ten-Span Sword, and regret for his actions. What had his defilements achieved but to envelop the world in darkness? This was his nature, to broil like a storm, to frighten and destroy what stood in his path.\\n\\nBut a storm could also herald life.\\n\\nAt a river side, Susano ventured upon an elderly couple, weeping and cradling their young daughter. Eight children, they’d had once, but now only one remained; seven devoured by the eight-headed serpent. Susano was resolved. To atone for his crimes, to prove his father wrong, to better himself, Susano would slay this beast.\\n\\nEight traps he laid, one for each head of the creature, with eight tubs of aromatic saké as bait. Slithering forward, the Orochi spread its gruesome heads to drink from the trapped tubs. Susano cut the rope. Gates dropped. The heads were imprisoned. One by one, he chopped the eight necks, until only the wriggling tail remained. Sweeping his blade split the reptilian hide, leaving notches in his blade but revealing a brilliant sword inside: the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.\\n\\nTo his sister, he gave the blade. An act of atonement, but not an apology. His true nature would never change, but his intention could.\\n\\nThough seen on the battlefield of the Gods, Susano’s fight is not truly against those foes, but within himself. He is a raging summer storm, struggling to focus that destructive power at evil, and atoning when the innocent are harmed."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Verdant Growth","Ability_5":{"Id":10578,"Summary":"Nature's Protection","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[],"description":"Enemies that successfully land a melee Basic Attack on Sylvanus have a 25% chance to be Rooted for 1s.

She loved him immediately and made him her king. Their children were Titans, beings even more powerful than they. In his fear and jealousy, Uranus buried the Titans within the earth. Terra began to see the arrogance, the vanity, the hatred in her husband. Conspiring with her children, she freed them and overthrew Uranus.\\n\\nYoungest of the Titans, Saturn, ruled next. Terra could not have been more proud, but prophecies claimed Saturn would be defeated by his children, just as Uranus had. To prevent this, Saturn consumed his offspring. All but one. Jupiter escaped, and with righteous fury split Saturn open, unleashing his swallowed siblings. Violently, they defeated the Titans, Terra’s children, and claimed the world as their own.\\n\\nMournful of the children she lost, Terra slept. And ages passed.\\n\\nBut the ravages of a new war have scarred her skin. Her grandchildren, those arrogant, vain, treacherous Gods that stole the world from her son, those Gods, so reminiscent of Uranus, bleed into her bones with every battle. Now, she finally rises from her slumber. She rises to claim the throne for herself."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.3,"Ability1":"Death Scythe","Ability_5":{"Id":9239,"Summary":"Harvester of Souls","Description":{"itemDescription":{"secondaryDescription":"","cost":"","cooldown":"","rankitems":[{"value":"20% of target's max HP","description":"HP Restore (Gods):"},{"value":"10% of target's max HP","description":"HP Restore (Minions):"},{"value":"5s","description":"Cooldown Reduction (Gods):"}],"description":"Enemy gods within his ultimate's execute Health threshold are revealed to Thanatos.

They are reaped by the nightmarish God of Death, whose grim visage strikes strange against the gleeful satisfaction he feels at performing his work. Thanatos is the very face of death.\\n\\nYet, to Thanatos, Mortals are easy prey. Their end is preordained, harvesting them but a game to pass the eons, but a God, a being beyond the mortal coil, now there is a creature Thanatos eyes with greedy longing. He despises the immortality other Gods covet. To him, it is a perversion and defiance of his very purpose.\\n\\nBut can a God truly die? As the Heavens clash and immortal blood spills on the Earth, Thanatos hungers to find out.

Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\\n\\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor’s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor’s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\n\\nSif, Thor’s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\n\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki’s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\n\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day.

Tyr, clothed in courage, brought the beast to their prison, where the Gods prepared shackles.\\n\\nHonor is not a stubborn oath, but the integrity to uphold what is right, even when it is not easy.\\n\\nUnder the guise of a test of strength, twice the Gods bound Fenrir, and twice he broke free. On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.\\n\\nJustice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.\\n\\nBound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr’s hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.\\n\\nOne handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible. As the cloud of war blackens the world, and fear grips the people, Tyr is stooped by the weight of expectation. With blade in hand, he takes the field. For he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.4,"Ability1":"Bladed Arrow (Thrown Axe)","Ability_5":{"Id":9800,"Summary":"Weapon

Dotted across the lands of the Faithful, shrines to Ullr can be found in remote, secluded hideaways. It is there that glory is found in the sanctity of a vow, once sworn, never broken, and bound by a ring, no matter how crude, then buried in the earth to weather the ages of time.\\n\\nThough rarely spoken of, he is highly regarded, even among the Gods, for it is Ullr, not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the All Father is away. Other Gods might use the opportunity to abuse the power, but Ullr’s rule is merely an extension thereof. So much so that only the innermost circle even know that Odin is gone.\\n\\nAll the more noticeable is it, then, that Ullr has abandoned this post to join the fray. Early on did Odin take the field of battle, leaving Ullr to manage the kingdom. So great a threat must this war be as to endanger the very survival of Asgard.

Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali’s demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali’s benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali’s sacrifice.\\n\\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson. Even the mightiest and most arrogant of kings can be humbled by the smallest of men."},{"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Ability1":"Backfire","Ability_5":{"Id":13271,"Summary":"Master

When they reach for weapons to wield in battle, it is Vulcan that forged them. When the very earth rumbles and mountains erupt in searing flame, it is Vulcan’s rage that burns. Smith of the Gods, Vulcan crafts with fire and forge as an artist would with paint and brush.\\n\\nAs an infant, so hideous was Vulcan that his disgusted mother, Juno, cast him into the sea from the heights of Mount Olympus. So great was the fall, it smashed one of Vulcan’s legs, a wound from which he would never recover.  Beneath the waves, a sea nymph, Thetis, rescued the child-god and raised him as her own. As Vulcan grew, he ventured to the surface and discovered fire and the art of smithing. His natural talents emerged and he forged wondrous jewels for his adopted mother.\\n\\nSummoned to a gala on Mount Olympus, Thetis wore Vulcan’s glittering gifts, but when Juno discovered Vulcan had made them, she jealously demanded he return to Mount Olympus. Angrily, Vulcan refused. In his stead, he sent a magnificent throne of gold and gems that imprisoned Juno when she sat upon it.\\n\\nFor three days Juno was so entombed, and would have remained so had not Jupiter, Vulcan’s father, interjected. To Vulcan he offered an exchange, Juno’s freedom for the hand of Venus, the most beautiful Goddess of Love. Vulcan agreed.\\n\\nThough his vengeance was served cold, the fire of spite still burns in Vulcan’s chest. Unable to truly forgive, he loses himself at the forge.

From his body dripped other beings that would become the ancestors of Gods, Men, Dwarves, and of course, Giants. Even the mighty Odin must claim Ymir as his grandfather. Yet Ymir, like all giants, was an evil creature and led his Giant brethren against the Gods. After ages of warfare, Odin and his brothers slew the Giant-King and forged the world from his remains.\\n\\nYet there are other whispers.

When Zeus was born, Rhea, Zeus’ mother, hid the child from Cronus and gave the Titan a rock in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed instead. In secret, Zeus grew up on the isle of Crete until he was old and strong enough to challenge his father. During their battle, Zeus slit open Cronus’ stomach, allowing his swallowed brothers and sisters to escape, slaying the Titan. Then, Zeus released the Cyclops and other beings Cronus had kept imprisoned. In gratitude, the Cyclops awarded Zeus control over lightning.\\n\\nWith his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, the three Gods drew lots to decide command of creation. Poseidon became king of the sea, Hades the underworld, and Zeus the sky. From his golden throne atop Mount Olympus, Zeus now rules Gods and Men with his wife Hera, upholding justice, hospitality, oaths, and honesty to all under his domain.\\n\\nYet, Zeus is a restless God, and while he holds high expectations for others, he does not keep those standards for himself. Chiefly, Zeus is nearly infamous for several infidelities to his wife which have resulted in dozens of children beget by other women, most famous of which are Hercules, Artemis, and Athena. Such wanton unfaithfulness is the source of great jealousy from Hera, though as King, Zeus can ultimately do as he wishes.\\n\\nWeather is dictated by the Thunder God’s mood.

Without guardians of equal strength, all would have fallen long ago. Zhong Kui was once a man with ambitions no greater than scholastic excellence, but in death became the perfect shield against evil’s onslaught.\\n\\nZhong Kui sought to pit his brilliant mind against the Imperial Examinations, tests to select councilors for the Emperor. With ease, he passed, but when the emperor saw his hideous face, he cast the scholar out. Offended, furious, Zhong Kui hurled himself repeatedly at the palace gates until his body was broken.\\n\\nFor his crime, Zhong Kui’s soul was judged by the King of Hell, but where the Emperor saw only ugliness, the King of Hell saw potential armed with genius. Zhong Kui was appointed Lord of Demons, tasked to forever hunt and ensnare the evils of the world.\\n\\nFor centuries, home owners and shopkeepers have adorned their buildings with Zhong Kui’s likeness, for that visage that once horrified the emperor now glares with purpose at unwelcome demons. Yet these days, it is not just shops and homes in peril, but the whole world. It does not take a mind like Zhong Kui’s to see evil’s hand in this War of the Gods. The time has come to bring these demons to task, and Zhong Kui means to smite them all."}]
